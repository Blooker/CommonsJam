  - Text: Location Value Tax - A tax system on land which rewards an efficient use
      of land that houses many people, and punishes the owners of land that is largely
      unoccupied. It stops the speculative land hoarding that prevents homes from
      being built.

  - Text: Location Value Tax - A tax system which would stop from buying up all the
      land around here to build luxury apartments and bungalows which are half-empty.
      It would reward smaller, more housing-efficient landlords such as yourself.
